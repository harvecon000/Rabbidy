There some interesting people up in this world
I think that Muybridge was a true pioneer of his field.
He literally invented the art of the motion picture.
If it wasnt for him we would probably not have had movies until much later in our history.
His research led to him creating the motion picture and it revolutionized the way that we do everything really.
If it wasnt for motion pictures there would be no video games or computers probably.
He changed the world with his research.
